## Analytics

<!-- preview -->

*这份API适用于[Commercial and Enterprise](https://www.mapbox.com/pricing/)计划。*

The Mapbox Analytics API returns API usage for services by resource. For example, it can calculate the number of geocoding requests made in a week with a specific access token.

```python
from mapbox import Analytics
```

### Retrieve analytics

Returns the request counts per day for given resource and period.

* If the `{resourceType}` is `tokens`, the `{id}` is the complete token.
* If the `{resourceType}` is `styles`, the `{id}` is the Style ID. Not to be confused with the Style _URL_, the id is the alphanumeric segment at the end of the style: the Style URL `mapbox://styles/user/cimdoca6f00` contains the Style ID `cimdoca6f00`, so the analytics request would have the path `/analytics/v1/styles/user/cimdoca6f00`.
* If the `{resourceType}` is `tilesets`, the `{id}` is a Map ID.

```endpoint
GET /analytics/v1/{resourceType}/{username}/{id}?period={period} analytics:read
```
